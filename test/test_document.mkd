Test Literate Maruku Document
=============================

This contains some code examples, that are used for testing.

Normal markdown code environments are simply rendered

    LiterateMarukuTest.this_code_block_will_not_be_executed = true

Annotated code environments are rendered and executed - in the root context.

    $this_code_block_will_be_executed = true
{: execute}

Code definitions also work across code environments, of course.

    a_test_method = lambda do |string|
      string
    end
{: execute}

And you may automatically attach the output of your code blocks.

    a_test_method.call("a test string")
{: execute attach_output}
